# Classification model for ECG waveform detection.

## Plan:
1. 11/27/2024: Downloading all the dataset needed, included: PTB-XL for Sinus, AFib and heart block and MIT-BIH VFDB (Malignant Ventricular Fibrillation Database) for VFib.
2. 11/28/2024: Try loading data from these two dataset and start combining them into one dataframe. Transform ECG signal into spectrogram.
3. 11/29/2024: Start visualizing.
4. 11/30/2024: Try making the model, applying augmentation, etc.
5. 11/30/2024: Evaluation.
